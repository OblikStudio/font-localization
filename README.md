# Localized Forms of Glyphs

### [Romanian (RO)](https://glyphsapp.com/tutorials/localize-your-font-romanian-and-moldovan)

The letters "S" and "T" with a cedilla "Ş" should turn to ones with a comma "Ș" in Romanian.

```
ŞȘ
```

**Supported in:** Roboto, Barriecito, DM Serif, Montserrat.

### [Polish (PL)](https://glyphsapp.com/tutorials/localize-your-font-polish-kreska)

Letters with acute accents should get the "kreska", which "is steeper than usual and originates from the optical center of the base letter."

```
ćńú
```

**Supported in:** Barriecito, Fira Sans, Playfair, Bahianita.

### [Deutch (DE)](https://glyphsapp.com/tutorials/localize-your-font-german-capital-sharp-s)

All tested fonts automatically convert the glyph based on adjacent characters without taking locale into account.

STRAßE
```

### [Turkish (TR)](https://glyphsapp.com/tutorials/localize-your-font-turkish)

When surrounded by uppercase letters, "i" should not turn to "I" but to "İ" instead. No tested languages support that, even with TR locale.

```
Iİi
Diyarbakır
DiYARBAKIR
```

**Not supported!**

### [Dutch (NL)](https://glyphsapp.com/tutorials/localize-your-font-accented-dutch-ij)

mí jn
```

### [Catalan (CA)](https://glyphsapp.com/tutorials/localize-your-font-catalan-punt-volat)

When two "l" are separated by a "·" (periodcentered), the space between those characters should be reduced.
